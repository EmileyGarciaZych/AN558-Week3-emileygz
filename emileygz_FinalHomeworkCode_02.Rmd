Background:

"Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session."

**Variables**

one call is one event

time interval = 2 hours/1 sitting

the mean number of events per time interval, λ = 15

the number of calls per sitting = k

"The Poisson Distribution is often used to model open ended counts of independently occurring events, for example the number of cars that pass a traffic intersection over a given interval of time or the number of times a monkey scratches itself during a given observation interval. The *probability mass function* for the Poisson distribution is described by a single parameter, λ, where λ can be interpreted as the mean number of occurrences of the event in the given interval."

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

```{r}
x <- 9 ## the first value over 8. 
l = 15 ## the mean number of events per time interval = 15.
cumulative <- 0 ## the combined probability
for(x in 9:31){ ## I used the range given later in the problem. The for loop will calculate the probability using the dpois function... dpois (x, lambda) = calculates Poisson distribution. 
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l) ## store the probability of one case in the probset variable. 
cumulative <- cumulative + probset ## add probset variable to cumulative variable.
x <- x+1 ## increase # of calls being calculated by 1. 
}
cumulative
```

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

```{r}
x <- 0 ## follow the same pattern as above. 
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
probset
```

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

k = 3 calls λ = 15 calls per sitting e = 2.718

```{r}
x <- 3 ## follow the same pattern as above. 
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
probset
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```{r}
x <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois (x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, col = "#6666FF", xlab = "number of calls per sitting", ylab = "probability", main = "Probability of Number of Calls Per Sitting") 
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}
simulation <- rpois (104, 15) ## use the rpois function to run a simulation. rpois (number of runs, lambda)
simulation ## print
```

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
hist(simulation, breaks = seq(0,30,1), probability = TRUE, col = "#6699FF", main = "Number of Calls Per Sitting (Simulation Values)", xlab = "number of calls", ylab = "probability") ## use the hist function to plot the data obtained in the part above. 
```

The initial Poisson mass distribution is symmetrical and bell shaped. The simulation distribution is also symmetrical and bell shaped. Both graphs have a peak at around 15 calls.

## Reflection:

\- I struggled with figuring out how to do probability of more than 8 calls. I decided to use a for loop but after looking at Jessica's code, I saw that her method was a lot more accurate and efficient. With mine, I had to insert an entire range which I made as 31 based on the range given in later questions. Jessica just used the principle that the probability of more than 8 calls would be equal to 1-probability of 8 or less calls.

\- I struggled with changing the theme of my html document. I was running into an error because I hadn't downloaded the prettydoc package in the right place. Juli helped me to fix it.

\- I also struggled with using the xlim() function. I found I didn't need to, to get the range I wanted. I'm confused about the difference about xlim and breaks.

\- Peer commentary helped me to see other ways to do a similar function in R. Jess' code was really well organized and it was interesting to me how she used some statistical principles to write the code efficiently. Cat was also really helpful cause I got to see what parts of my code stood out to an observer. I was complimented on my graphs and how I made them appear more cheerful and inserted titles. Now I know to keep doing that. Cat's comments also helped me to know where my code was confusing so I could add more comments and make it clearer to an observer.
